# The exam has a total of 100 points and for each task 
# the point is given in square brackets.
# The exam has 6 parts and the total number of points by part is:
# 15 pts : Part I, general R commands
# 20 pts : Part II, plotting
# 15 pts : Part III, apply and by statements
# 15 pts : Part IV, functions 
# 15 pts : Part V, simulations

#100 pts in Total

# If you spend about 30 min or so reading instructions and the like
# this gives you 1.5 min per point -- the exam is LONG ON PURPOSE!
# Please just work your way through it the best you can, prioritizing
# things you can easily do and remember everyone else is also
# racing the clock and will be graded on a curve.

# [2 pts]
# Create [y], a list of length 10 where list k
# stores the output of the k-times multiplication
# table, including values up to 1000 so
# y[[1]] is 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000
# y[[2]] is 2, 4, 6, ..., 1000
# y[[3]] is 3, 6, 9, ..., 999

v <- sample(1:6, 100, replace=T)

# [1 pt]
# Create [w], a character vector of length 26 with entries:

m <- matrix(rnorm(100,8),10,10)
  
# For the next few tasks you will use the data frame ChickWeight

# To get the size of the data frame type
# dim(ChickWeight)

#### PART II : Plotting [20 pts]

##### Cars [8 pts total, 2+3+3]

# Make a box plot of [mpg] by [cyl] (so 3 boxplots in one plot)
boxplot(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$cyl)

# [3 pts]
# Use the function [lm()] to fit a regression model of [qsec] (1/4 mile time) regressed on [hp] (horsepower)
# Make a scatterplot of [qsec] versus [hp] and add the regression line to it
# Hint: the regression coefficients are stored in [coef] in the lm object and you can use [abline()] to
# add a line to a plot
plot(mtcars$qsec,mtcars$hp)
abline(lm(mtcars$hp~mtcars$qsec)$coeff)

# [3 pt]
# Make a scatterplot of [disp] (on y-axis) versus [wt] 
# where disp is the engine displacement in cu. in. and wt is the weight of the car in lb/1000.
# Color the plotting symbol by [am] (automatic or manual) (any 2 colors)
# Edit the labels on the x-axis and y-axis to state what the variables are.
# Hint: first do the plot without adding the colors.
plot(mtcars$disp,mtcars$wt,col=c("blue","red"),xlab="Disp",ylab="Weight")


##### We will now use the World Bank Data [12 pts]
load("WorldBank.RData")

# [4 pts]
# Make a scatterplot of life expectancy ["life.expectancy"] vs. fertility ["fertility.rate"]
# The plotting symbol should be a small dot (.)
# Please color the symbols by region (pick any color for each region)
# You do _NOT_ need to add a legend saying which color is which region.
# Put on custom made x-axis and y-axis labels that fully describe the variables
# Add a vertical line at fertility=2.1 (the rate needed to maintain constant population size)
plot(WorldBank$fertility.rate,WorldBank$life.expectancy, pch=".", xlab="Fertility Rate", ylab="Life Expectancy", col=WorldBank$region)
abline(v=2.1)

# [4 pts]
# Do you see patterns in the plot?  You just plotted these variables for all years between 1960 and 2014.
# Please redo the plot, but this time put two plots side by side (hint: before plotting set par(mfrow=...) )
# The left plot should include only data from 1960, the right one only from 2013.
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(WorldBank[WorldBank$year==1960,]$fertility.rate,WorldBank[WorldBank$year==1960,]$life.expectancy, pch=".", xlab="Fertility Rate", ylab="Life Expectancy", col=WorldBank$region, main="Year 1960")

# [4 pts]
# Make a histogram of GDP only for observations where the lending rating is "IDA"
# The width of the bars should be approximately 250 (use breaks to set how many bars)
# Add an x-axis label and a title.

# LEAVE AS IS:
load("rainfallCO.rda")

# [2 pts]
# Create [max.rain], a vector where each entry is the _maximum_ element of the
# corresponding vector in the list rain

#max.rain <- <your code here>
max.rain <- sapply(rain, max)
    
# [5 pts]
# Create [max.diff.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# __maximum absolute difference__ in rainfall on two consecutive days
# Hint: you can use the function [diff()] to get the difference between entry i and i+1 in a vector 
# and the function [abs()] for absolute value
# max.diff.rain <- <your code here>


# [5 pts]
# Create [prop.rain], a vector of length 5 where each entry is the 
# number of rain days (i.e. rain > 0) as a function of total days

#prop.rain <- <your code here>
prop.rain <- sapply(day, function(x) if(x>0){})

# [3 pts]
# Make a plot with 6 panels and plot the histogram of the rainfall for each weather station
# in a separate panel (there will be one empty panel)
# use an apply statment to the the plotting
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
lapply(rain,hist)

#   sd (the standard deviation), default 1
#   n (the number of observations), default 1000
#   plot.hist (a logical variable, should we plot a histogram), default TRUE
# Output: 
#   a vector of n normal random variables with mean=mean and sd=sd
#   an optional plot

# [6 pts]
# Write a function [standardizeVar] with
# Input :
#     [m] : a numeric matrix
#     [cols] : TRUE or FALSE (default TRUE)
# Output :
#     a matrix of the same size as [m] where if cols==TRUE the columns have been standardized
#     and if cols==FALSE the rows have been standardized
#     we standardize by subtracting the mean of the column/row and dividing by the sd of the column/row

#    [cases] : a numeric vector (length j =10)
#    [controls] : a numeric vector  (length m = 7)
#    [k] : a scalar, the number of permutations, default=5000

#    Assume that [cases] was of length j and [controls] of length m
#    Now select at random j individuals from the whole sample (i.e. all j+m observations)
#    and assign them to be cases, and the remaining m individuals as controls
#    Calculate the value [mean(cases)-mean(controls)] for each of these new samples

# Output
#    A vector of length k where each element is the value 
#    mean(cases)-mean(controls) for one permutation

# So in each of the B games you have to :
#    generate the winning numbers
#    set a counter for jackpot winners to 0
#    generate a ticket for each player in turn, if they had the winning numbers 
#    increase the counter by 1

#function <- NumJackpot(k, B){
