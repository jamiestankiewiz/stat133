#### Simulation
# Write a function, [dice_sum()], that takes as input:
# [k] : the number of dice rolled
# [B] : the number of rolls
# and returns:
# [dsum] : a vector of length B where each element is the sum of a roll of k dice

# So if k=1 pick a number between 1 and 6 at random B times and return them,
# if k=2 then in each roll you pick twice a number between 1 and 6 at random,
# calculate their sum, do this B times and return
# and so on.

# We've set the default inputs to k=2 and B=100

dice_sum <- function(k=2, B=100){
   vec <- vector("numeric", B)
   
   for (i in 1:B) {
   vec[B] <- sum(sample(1:6,k, replace=T))
   }
}

#### String manipulation

phrases <- c("dog", "doggy", "den", "good boy", "Really?", "How much?", "Only $8", "dogdogdog", "Oh god")

# Create a vector [text1] that lists the elements in phrases 
# where the SECOND TO LAST character is "o" (lower case o).
#text1 <- <your code here>
text1 <- strsplit(paste(phrases, sep="", collapse=""), "")

# Create a vector [text2] that lists the elements in phrases that
# START with the letter "d"
#text2 <- <your code here>
text2 <- phrases[grep("\\<d", phrases)]

# Create a variable [no.punct] that equals the number of phrases with a punctuation mark in it.
# no.punct <- <your code here>
no.punct <- phrases[grep("[:punct:]", phrases)]

# Create a vector [even] that is of length 1000 and has the entries
# "even2", "even4", ...
# with no separation between the word and the letter

#even <- <your code here>
even <- paste("even", seq(2,2*1000,2), sep="")

# Start with [hotelCal] which is a character string, create 
# a _vector_ (not list) [hotelCal.split] which 
# stores the words of [hotelCal] each as a separate element.
# Also, convert all upper case letters to lower case.
# Please remove all punctuation marks.

hotelCal <- "On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair. Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air. Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light. My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night.  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell.  And I was thinking to myself: 'This could be heaven or this could be hell'. Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way."

# hotelCal.split <- <your code here> 
hotelCal.split <- { hotelCal <- tolower(hotelCal)
                    hotelCal <- unlist(strsplit(hotelCal,""))
                    hotelCal <- hotelCal[hotelCal != "[:punct:]"]
                    hotelCal <- paste(hotelCal,"")
                   # hotelCal <- strsplit(hotelCal, collapse="")
                    return(hotelCal) 
}

# Write a function called updateDate. Your function should take the following
# arguments
#   <dates>: a character vector of dates of the form "month, year" (e.g. "May, 2001")
#   <old.yr>: a string indicating the year for which elements will be updated
#     (e.g. "2002")
#
# and return the following
#   <updated.dates>: a character vector of dates where <old.yr> has been replaced by
#     '2015'. This vector should only contain the elements whose date has been
#     updated. For example updateDate(c('May, 2008', 'June, 2011'), '2008') should
#     return 'May, 2015'.
updateDate <- function(dates, old.yr) {
   temp <- grep(old.yr, dates)
   newdates <- gsub(old.yr, '2015', dates[temp])
   return(newdates)
}


# Write a function called [abbreviate] that takes in a vector of strings and returns
# a vector of the same length with only the first [k] characters from the orignal vector entries.

abbreviate <- function(vector, k){
   temp <- strsplit(paste(temp3, collapse=""), "")
   temp <- unlist(temp)
   print(temp[1:k])
}
