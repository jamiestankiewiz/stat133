Plots
Are the multi-dimensional scaling plots correct? 1/2
##!! The second plot does not show president names printed in a color corresponding
##!! to their party. Here are some things to consider:
##!! - text() needs an x and y argument so you might have text(mds[,1], mds[,2], â€¦)
##!! - line 425 and surrounding could be:
##!! for(i in 1:length(unique(presidents))){
##!!   presParty[i] <- as.character(speechesDF$party)[speechesDF$Pres==unique(presidents)[i]][1]
##!!  }
##!! - one more change is need din line 437.
Is the hierarchical clustering plot appropriate? 1/1
Are the five plots showing speech year and sentences/words/characters/word length/sentence length well done? 5/5
