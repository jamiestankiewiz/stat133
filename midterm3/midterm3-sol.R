# Write a function called numDollarElements. Your function should take the following
# arguments
#   <chvec>: A character vector containing strings of letters, possibly 
#     with the "$" symbol
#
# and return the following
#   <num.dollar>: an integer indicating how many elements of <chvec> contain the "$"
#     symbol. For example: numDollarElements(c('dollar', 'd$llar', '$$$')) should return 2
numDollarElements <- function(chvec){
  ats <- grep("\\$", chvec)
  return(length(ats))
}

# Write a function called prodDigits that compute the product of all (single) digits in
# a string.  The function should return 0 if there is no digit in the
# string. Your function should take the following arguments:
#   <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and return the following
#   <total>: A single number (the product of all digits in chvec)

prodDigits <- function(chvec){
  
  temp <- unlist(strsplit(chvec, ""))
  prod(as.numeric(grep("[0-9]", temp, value = T)))
}

# Some test cases:
# all.equal(prodDigits("1z3p ! 22"), 12)
# all.equal(prodDigits("abcdefg"), 0)



# Write a function called hisToHer that converts every instance of 
# him in a string to her; every instance of he to she and every instance 
# of his to hers. You can assume everything is lower case. Be careful not 
# to replace words that contain him/he/his (eg you don't want to
# replace the with ther). Your function should take the argument
#   <chvec>: A character vector
#
# and return
#   <herchvec>: The same character vector with the required substitutions.

hisToHer <- function(chvec) {
  herchvec <- gsub("\\<his\\>", "her", chvec)

test8 <- hisToHer("his hat was red")
test9 <- hisToHer("I saw him he")

# Write a function called mostCommonLetter that finds the most common letter in a 
# string. If there is a tie for most common letter return all of the letters that 
# were most common. Your function should convert all letters in the string to 
# *lower case* and you should remove  everything other than letters. 
# Your function has the argument
#  <chvec>: A character vector of length 1 (chvec contains only 1 string)
#
# and it should return
#  <letter> The most common letter or letters in the string.
# For example mostCommonLetter("aabbccccdddd") should return 
# [1] "c" "d"
